<p>Hi <%= @cr_access_data.full_name %>,</p>

<p>This is a friendly reminder that you may be due for your second dose of COVID-19 Vaccine. If you have not already
  done so, please schedule your next appointment by calling your healthcare provider or going to your state/county

<p>You should <strong>get your second shot as close to the recommended <%= @cr_access_data.recommended_weeks %>-weeks as possible.</strong> You should not get the second dose
  early.</p>
